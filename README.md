# Temporal Extensions to SHOP

This repository contains the code for temporal ("durative") planning extensions for the SHOP planner.  These were developed for SHOP2, and described in the ICAPS 2006 paper ["Durative Planning in HTNs"](https://rpgoldman.goldman-tribe.org/papers/icaps06-short.pdf).

The code here has not yet been adapted to SHOP3, so is not ready for prime-time. We hope to update it, but don't have much in the way of time to do this at present (July 2022). Contributions would be very welcome!
